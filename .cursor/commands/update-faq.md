could you please update DESIGN_FAQ & DX_FAQ based on the changes we are trying to acheive.

the goal is not to write many lines of docs, but have concise document with key design decisions made in projects - so we could easily explain why we are done something, instead of how

idea is:

1. DESIGN_FAQ - Focus on Why (design decisions): for maintaing the ECS - to concentrate more on why instead of how. Make it shortest form of FAQ understandable for AI Agent.

For example:
Q: Why we cannot use Entity.index and should get its location?
A: Because etc..

Keep concise & short: 2-3 sentences, include key trade-offs and rationale.

2. DX_FAQ - Focus on How (usage): Developer Experience API is how we can use ecs from developer perspective. Short and concise and concentrates on smallest use cases (same FAQ format)

# Rules

0. Always check against codebase and suggest best patterns and practices.

1. Acheive changes: new content + making existing docs more concise. Short & Smart.

2. Optimize for AI agent understanding.

3. No duplication between the two documents
